Have you started thinking about your coding goals for 2016? I've been thinking about mine for the past three weeks.

For 2016 I'm going to learn [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) development.

Learning iOS development has been on my mind for the past six months. Last week I decided to stop *thinking* about it and to start *doing* something about it after I completed [end-to-end testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#System_testing) of an iOS application created by the [mobile application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_application_development) team (mobile dev team, for short) where I work.

My employer's mobile dev team creates both iOS and [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29) versions of the company's software, with first priority on the iOS version. As it is where I work, iOS before Android is the order that I notice when reading about mobile development at other companies. 

I'm not a member of the mobile dev team. The team I'm on develops a web-based application primarily coded in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). Where I work, emphasis on mobile development, with first priority on iOS, is where the action is growing. Whenever the opportunity presents itself I help the mobile dev team test the interaction between their mobile application and my project team's web-based application.

I want to eventually move to the mobile applications side of software development.  

## Step 1: Get a Mac

The last Apple computer I owned was the [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe)... years ago. For 2016 I need an [Apple MacBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_family) computer on which to learn iOS development. 

I bought a new 13.3" MacBook Pro that set me back around $1,500. Instead of opening the new MacBook Pro when I got home I let it sit unopened inside the [BestBuy](http://www.bestbuy.com) bag overnight. The next day I returned the MacBook Pro, box seals intact, because I couldn't justify the expense. 

After searching [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) I decided to go with a Late-2008 15" MacBook Pro with 4[GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) and a 250GB hard disk. I got mine for less than $500.

I reformatted the hard disk and put a clean installation of [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) El Capitan (free download from the [Mac App Store](https://www.apple.com/mac/)) on it. I also installed [Xcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) 7 (also a free download from the Mac App Store). The performance of both OS X El Capitan and Xcode 7 is fine for my beginner iOS learner needs.  

This morning I received an email notice that my 8GB memory upgrade kit and 250GB [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) order (around $160 total) for my MacBook Pro from [crucial.com](https://www.crucial.com) was shipped. I'm looking forward to opening the MacBook Pro next weekend and upgrading it.

Better than it was before. [Better... stronger... faster](https://youtu.be/HoLs0V8T5AA).        

## Step 2: Learn Objective-C

Other than the simple [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) "Hello, world!" program that I wrote while exploring the Xcode 7 IDE, I have no Objective-C coding experience.

After researching several beginner-level Objective-C books I decided to use [Programming in Objective-C, 6th Edition](http://amzn.to/1lnC748) by Stephen Kochan. As of this writing the book is selling for $32.48 on [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com).  

I noticed on amazon.com that the 4th Edition of Kochan's book was published December 2011, the 5th Edition was published December 2012, and the current 6th Edition was published December 2013. Two years have passed since the last update. This got me wondering if Kochan has a 7th Edition of the book ready for a December 2015 release. 

A bit of research on the internet for a 7th Edition release announcement of Kochan's book came up empty. This afternoon I sent the 7th Edition question to [Kochan's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/raywritescode/status/670696320777232384). No response from him yet as of this writing.

Objective-C is an extension of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29). Until I get a copy of Kochan's Objective-C book in my hands, I'll continue reviewing the C language to prepare for Objective-C.

The C language book that I'm using is [C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.to/1lnBJTh) by K.N. King.  

## Step 3: Learn iOS

I've read that it's possible to dive into learning iOS without any prior knowledge of Objective-C. This means having to learn both Objective-C and iOS at the same time.

I'd rather learn Objective-C before starting on iOS.

Which means that it's premature of me at this time to think about Step 3.

## Why Not Learn Swift Before Objective-C?

[Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%28programming_language%29) is the new programming language created by Apple as an alternative to Objective-C for iOS development. It was introduced at Apple's [Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) in June 2014.

I decided to learn Objective-C before Swift after reading [iOS Developers Need to Know Objective-C](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/ios-developers-need-to-know-objective-c/) by Aaron Hillegass of [Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com) and [Apple Swift: Should Beginners Still Learn Objective-C?](http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/apples-swift-should-beginners-still-learn-objective-c) by Jordan Clifton. 

## Conclusion

Learning iOS development is my goal for 2016 because I want to shift my career to the mobile applications side of software development. 

I chose iOS over Android because at most of the companies where I live that create mobile applications, first priority is iOS and Android second. I decided to learn Objective-C before Swift because as of this writing, Objective-C is more widely used than Swift in the working world.

Because I'm new to iOS development I don't need the latest MacBook. My second-hand MacBook Pro 15" (Late-2008) runs the latest versions of OS X and Xcode fine. For less than $650 I now have the **basic** tools needed to begin the journey of learning iOS development in 2016. 

Got the machine. Got the software. Make the time. [Do it](https://youtu.be/VAVLOHbqWd4).

What are your coding goals for 2016?

**Afterthoughts**

* I'm delaying enrolling in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) until I'm ready to deploy iOS apps to a physical iOS device.

* As of this writing I don't own an iPhone, iPad, or other iOS device. I do have access to an iPad (brother's) and an iPad mini (mom's) when needed. When I'm ready to buy an iOS device it's going to be an [Apple store refurbished](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals) one. 

* I plan on using my Late-2008 MacBook Pro until its performance slows to a crawl because I've become a [Jedi Master](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Master) iOS developer and the MacBook Pro can't keep up with me... or if a version of OS X is released that the MacBook Pro is not equipped to run. My bet's on the latter.

* Stephen Kochan's Twitter shows that he's working on a [Swift Programming book](https://twitter.com/sgkochan/status/586360085619675136). A 7th Edition of his Objective-C book might not be coming out until December 2016.
