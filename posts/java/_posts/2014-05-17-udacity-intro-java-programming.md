[Udacity] (http://www.udacity.com), in collaboration with [San Jose State University] (http://www.sjsu.edu/), offers an [Intro to Programming: Problem Solving with Java] (https://www.udacity.com/course/cs046) course that I’ve recommended to friends and colleagues who are non-programmers and who are interested in learning about computer programming.

I’ve recommended the course based solely on the course’s primary instructor, [Cay Horstmann] (http://www.hostmann.com), who is a professor of computer science at San Jose State University and a prolific author of books about programming languages and computer science. I’m familiar with Professor Horstmann’s work from having studied the Java programming language from his excellent [Core Java] (http://www.horstmann.com/corejava.html) series of books.

Two Sundays ago I decided work through Professor Horstmann’s Java programming course on Udacity to supplement the studying that I’m doing for the OCA Java SE 7 Programmer I exam. It was also a way for me to properly evaluate the course for recommendation to others.

The [Intro to Programming: Problem Solving with Java] (https://www.udacity.com/course/cs046) main page estimates 4 months to complete the course, assuming 6 hours/week dedicated to working through the lessons.

Every day for the past two weeks I dedicated four hours on weekdays and six hours on weekends watching the lessons at 1.5x speed and completing all of the quizzes, two midterm exams, all programming assignments, and the final exam.

I completed the course in 13 days.

## Do I still recommend Udacity’s Intro to Programming course?

Absolutely and more so! I was a fan of Professor Horstmann’s work from his Core Java books. I’m now a bigger fan of his work from the very well planned, presented, and executed Java programming course that he and his course co-creators, Sara Tansey and Cheng-Han Lee, put together.

After a high-level overview of programming and of the Java programming environment in Lesson 1, the course dove into Objects and Classes in Lesson 2. Subsequent lesson topics covered Fundamental Data Types, Decisions, Loops, ArrayList and Arrays, deeper study of Classes, and ended with Interfaces and Inheritance.

The lessons used a tag-team approach between Professor Horstmann (who taught the Java concepts) and Sara Tansey (who led the programming assignments).

Professor Horstmann explained the Java concepts clearly and with a laid-back style while still managing to slip in the occasional programming joke through a subtle play on words.

Sara Tansey explained in a clear and straightforward manner both the requirements for each programming assignment and reviews of assignment solutions, the latter which you got access to only after you submitted your code solution. She also has nice looking expressive hands, which you see a lot of throughout the course.

Dozens of mini-quizzes were given for each lesson, which helped me to better retain the knowledge and skills objectives for the lesson. I also liked that the programming assignments gradually became more challenging as additional layers of Java concepts were introduced.

## Was there anything that I didn’t like about the course?

The course used the [BlueJ] (http://www.bluej.org/) editor, which is a free Java IDE (integrated development environment) developed specifically for beginning Java programmers. I didn’t like the BlueJ editor’s user interface. Really the problem was with me not wanting to use the BlueJ editor, which was being taught as minor part of the course.

## Pace Yourself

I don’t recommend you trying to complete the estimated 4 month course in 13 days like I did. The overly ambitious pace disrupted my sleeping pattern and I ate poorly during that time period. I maintained that pace to finish the course by 11:59 pm on Friday, May 16, before [Udacity phased-out issuing certificates for completing their free courseware offerings] (http://blog.udacity.com/2014/04/phasing-out-certificates-of-free16.html).

For someone new to programming and to Java I recommend completing one lesson per week. There are nine lessons (as of this writing) so you’ll complete the course in nine weeks, which is half of Udacity’s estimated completion time.

The Java course remains available to you for free. However, you will not receive a certificate of course completion unless you participate in Udacity’s new optional  fee-based Verified Certificate program.


# Conclusion

If you’re a non-programmer who is interested in learning about object-oriented programming using the Java language or if you’re a software developer wanting to refresh your basic Java knowledge, then I highly recommend Udacity’s [Intro to Programming: Problem Solving with Java] (https://www.udacity.com/course/cs046) course.

Here’s a preview of the course.
