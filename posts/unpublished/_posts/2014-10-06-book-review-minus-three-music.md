# Pragmatic Technical Book Reviewer

My coding-related activites for September didn't include blogging. Instead, I took advantage of the opportunity to do a technical review of the first three chapters of the soon-to-be-released book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1941222595/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1941222595&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=LXNM7CYPH34Z7PD7">Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1941222595" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 by [Jeff Langr] (http://langrsoft.com), which will be published by [The Pragmatic Bookshelf] (https://pragprog.com/).

I've reviewed (and edited) technical documents as part of my normal activities in previous software jobs. Reviewing Jeff's book was my first experience contributing as a technical reviewer for a book author and a book publisher. 

I'm looking forward to reading the published version of *Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit* and seeing which of my contributions made it into the book. 

I'm also looking forward to more opportunities in the future to contribute as a technical reviewer for The Pragmatic Bookshelf and for other software developer book publishers.

# T-Minus Three Months

October marks the last three months of my transition preparation from software quality assurance to software development. 

Java is my primary development language, so I'm focusing my coding efforts for the rest of the year on mastering the language as best as I can. 

Improving my understanding and implementation of algorithms is the other skill that I'm working on for the next three months.

# Time Flies

It's easy for me to lose track of time when I'm writing code or doing other software development work at my computer. I enjoy the activity and mental exercise so much. 

Last month I picked up the habit of using a countdown timer to remind me when to take work breaks. For every hour that I schedule for coding, I work for 50 minutes and then take a 10 minute break away from the computer. 

When I'm away from the computer I'm learning...

# Musical Code

Last month I resumed [learning how to play the piano] (http://www.youtube.com/user/raysantospiano/about). It's a hobby that I started in November 2013. I'm actually teaching myself how to play both piano and guitar but I'm progressing faster on piano.

Learning how to read written musical notes and to understand how the notes work together to form a song concept, and then translating those notes as sounds on a musical instrument to hear the song, reminds me of the software code compilation and execution process.

Code (song notes) is processed by the compiler (musician) to produce an executable program (song).

What I like most about learning how to play "musical code" is that if executed properly, the songs provide listening pleasure for others.
