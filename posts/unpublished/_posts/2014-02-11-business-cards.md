Three weeks ago I thought about buying personal business cards to give out to people I meet at technical networking events. I found a site online, [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/category/business-cards.aspx), offering 250 business cards on sale for $10. 

Without putting much thought into its design, I used a pre-defined business card template and ordered the following card:

It’s a simple and minimalist card that tells you the basics. Who I am, What I do, and Where (via website, email, postal mail, voicemail) to reach me. Vistaprint did a great job with the raised printing and the cards were printed on heavy stock paper. 

I was very satisfied with the quality of the business cards.

Having new business cards led me one night to reading various articles online about basic business card design. I finished that evening’s reading with a new appreciation for business card design.

It also resulted in me wanting to make better designed business cards.

## If I Could Do It Over

1. Don’t use a business card template (horizontal bar is from the template).

2. Remove the website address (redundant because of the email address).

3. Remove the postal address (I rarely use postal mail).

4. Make my name font larger and color it a darker blue.

5. Add a job title (or maybe not).

6. Make the tag line’s font larger (hard to read without eyeglasses).

7. Come up with a better tag line. Also use *and* instead of *&*

8. Display the phone number using a cleaner looking format.

9. Display the phone number from an international perspective.

10. Make use of the blank back side of the card.

## Doing It Over

Yesterday I went back to the drawing board on the VistaPrint site. I created one candidate design and let it sit for an hour or two before revisiting it to make another candidate design. I repeated this process throughout the day and came up with five candidates.

### Candidate One

I stayed with the minimalist text-only design of my original business card instead of choosing one of the dozens of card themes decorated with photos or colorful graphics. I like how simple and uncluttered the front of Candidate One looks. 

I’m iffy about the *Software Developer* title because it’s a title and I don’t care much for titles. The internationalized phone number without the extra characters looks cleaner than the format used on my original card. 

I used the back of Candidate One to display a new tag line and to include additional social media info.

### Candidate Two

Using Candidate One as the base, I made the last name all capital letters for visual interest.  To describe the work performed, *Develops Software* replaces *Software Developer*. 

It also fits neatly under the name. I also increased the font one size for all the text.

### Candidate Three

*Develops Software* looked strange to me after looking at it again a couple hours later. Using Candidate Two as the base, I replaced *Develops Software* with the tag line taken from the back of the card. 

The back of the card now has more white space for handwritten notes.

### Candidate Four

I used Candidate Three as the base. The tag line under the name sounded after-the-fact to me so I replaced it with *Software Design and Development* which sounds present-moment. 

I returned the tag line to the back of the card and noticed the alliteration formed by the tag line’s last three words. I dropped *Software* from the tag line to emphasize the alliteration. 

I also liked the visual of all three words starting with *De* and ending with *ed*. The resulting *Software Design and Development* on the front of the card followed by *Designed, Developed, Delivered* on the back of the card flows naturally in my mind.

### Candidate Five

Finally, using Candidate Four as the base, I replaced the website and LinkedIn URLs with QR (Quick Response) codes. 

The QR codes look cool and there’s still enough white space at the center of the card for handwritten notes.

# Conclusion

Learning about basic business card design and making these five candidates was a fun project. After a few days I’ll review the five candidates with a fresh perspective and pick my favorite design.

If you’re thinking about making personalized software developer business cards for yourself and you want to be more adventurous than my minimalist design approach, you might find the following business card designs inspiring:

* Don Ho’s [Notepad++ themed](http://imgur.com/zP0wd) card.

* Carl Asman’s [edlin themed](http://crdna.com/post/17129018387/coded-business-card-design) card.

* Albert Hwang’s [Vim and Windows Notepad themed](http://albert-hwang.com/2011/12/re-my-business-card/) cards.

A blog post about business cards wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the business card scene from [American Psycho](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/).

*Trivia: all the cards have the same misspelled word. What is it?*
