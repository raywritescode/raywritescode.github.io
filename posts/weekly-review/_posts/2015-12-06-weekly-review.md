* The MacBook Pro upgrades that I planned for this weekend didn't happen because the 8GB memory kit and the 256GB SSD that I ordered on November 28 didn't arrive on Friday. [crucial.com](http://www.crucial.com/)'s delivery tracking shows tomorrow as the updated delivery date.

* I finished reviewing chapters 6 and 7 of [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://amzn.to/1O2vzz7) by K.N. King. C code that I wrote during the review and for the programming exercises for each chapter are available at the following links:

    * [github code repository for Chapter 6](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/tree/master/ch06)
    * [github code repository for Chapter 7](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/tree/master/ch07)

    Total coding study time invested this week is 8 hours. Excluding weekends, my study sessions typically start after 6 pm.

* *Bookshelf* and *Study Log* are two new links at the top of this site. 
    * *Bookshelf* - The titles of books on people's bookshelves have always interested me. For my coding hobby I'm especially interested in the book titles on other programmers' bookshelves. *Bookshelf* lists the software development and software testing books that I own. Digital books are excluded.
    * *Study Log* is the most active page on this site. It shows the progress of my coding studies and the time invested for each study session.

* Coding and coding-related plans for this coming week:
    * Review Chapter 8 - Arrays of *C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition.*
    * Install the 8GB memory kit and the 256GB SSD upgrades in the MacBook Pro.
