* This week I dedicated only 2.5 hours studying *Chapter 9 - Functions* of [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393979504&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=FXGSFN72DGVZSLIR). 

    My coding studies ended on Thursday 12/24 at Section 9.3 Arguments, where I explored using a [multidimensional array as a function parameter](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/blob/183734364152c954e01c9708c45b0697cb76a0ab/ch09/review/multi_dim_array_arg.c).

* I've decided to take a short break from coding studies for the December 25 and New Year's holidays. I'll resume my coding studies on Monday, January 4, 2016.
