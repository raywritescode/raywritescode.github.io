* **Happy Birthday, Alyza!** 

    I have two children, both girls. Alyza is my first daughter. She turned 25 today, January 3.

* In the previous *Week Ending* post I wrote that I'm taking a short break from coding studies. Total hours this week spent on coding studies is zero. 

    This is a blog about coding. Because I don't have any coding specific work from this week to write about, I'll write about non-coding topics: *Star Wars*, video gaming, and cars.  

* I watched [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496) and I'm glad that I paid an extra $5 above the standard movie ticket price to watch it on an extra-wide screen and with an enhanced sound system. 

    The special effects were top-notch and I liked all the new characters that were introduced. Seeing characters from the earlier *Star Wars* movies gave me a sense of nostalgia. The storyline gave me many moments of deja vu mostly connected to the original 1977 *Star Wars (A New Hope)*. 

* Until this week I wasn't interested in video games because the hours spent playing video games seemed like a waste of time. 

    Earlier this week I got a hold of [Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Call of Duty: Black Ops III bundle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018V3ISJ2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B018V3ISJ2&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=WJ2KM62EINL6GV5M) for less than $300 out-the-door. I'd been contemplating buying a gaming console for several months and the heavily discounted holiday sales price encouraged me to buy it. 

    After I connected the PS4 to my television and got *Black Ops III* running, I intended to explore the game for about 15 minutes. After what felt like 15 minutes I glanced at my watch and found that 60 minutes had passed. I ended up playing *Black Ops III* for another hour.

    Unfortunately (or fortunately), the PS4 stopped working the next day. I diagnosed the problem being the [blue light of death](http://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PS4_Blue_Light_Problem). After trying to fix the problem unsuccessfully using various suggestions found on PS4 forums, I repacked the PS4 in its original packaging and box, returned it to the store as defective, and I got my money back.

    That evening after returning the PS4 I read an article on reddit called [Why PC?](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide) that teaches readers how to get into PC gaming and to take advantage of what PC gaming has to offer, and to dispel myths about PC gaming "that the console industry has been spinning up in an attempt to remain on top despite declining relevance."

    I decided to give PC gaming a try so I installed [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) on my computer and I bought [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00269QLJ2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00269QLJ2&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=ENAMWOPBJ4YZR43E), which was on discounted sale for $9.99. I found the gaming experience on my laptop computer just as good (if not better) as on the PS4. $9.99 vs. $289. PC gaming for the win.

    When my brother learned that I liked playing first-person-shooter games he recommended I try playing stealth games, which are the games he likes playing. My brother recommended a game from 2003 called [Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IBKFEES/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IBKFEES&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=X3UEWXH3G56LLDP6), which I found for discounted sale on Steam for $4.99.

    Unlike the *Call of Duty* games where your character is a member of a team that shoots down the bad guys who get in your way to reaching your mission's checkpoints and mission objective, *Splinter Cell* has you working alone with the goal of reaching your mission's checkpoints and objectives without being detected by the enemy. 

    I found myself enjoying playing *Splinter Cell* much more than *Call of Duty* because *Splinter Cell* drops you in the middle of a hostile environment, with little or no guidance on how to solve the given problem, and you must solve the problem as efficiently as possible and without disturbing the environment that your character is in.

    The planning, patience, and creative thinking needed to complete a *Splinter Cell* mission undetected reminds me of the planning, patience, and creative thinking needed to complete the more challenging C programming projects. 

    Now that I see value in video games (depending on the genre) and that I'm open to playing video games, my second daughter, Claire, wants me to play [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com), which is her favorite game. I've gone as far as to install *League of Legends* on my laptop computer. As of this writing I haven't played the game.

    One of my nephews, [Keenan](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Rhux), is a professional *League of Legends* gamer.

* Cars to me are merely a tool to get me from point A to point B. I currently drive a 1998 Honda Accord DX, of which I am the third owner. I've owned the car since June 2015. 

    I prefer driving older cars because the engines have more space around them to work on. Older cars also cost less to buy, to insure, and to maintain (as long as the previous owners took good care of the car).

    For the past three months the Accord's dashboard lights for 'check engine' and 'brake' remained lit when driving the car. Also, a heavy rattling noise came from the driver's side of the engine every time I started the car and almost every time the car slowed to a stop. I didn't feel any urgent need to fix those car problems, though others might have felt differently. I decided to get the car problems fixed while on holiday time off from work.

    I initially planned to take the Accord to an auto repair shop the morning of New Year's Eve and decided instead to investigate the problems myself. I'm glad that I did.

    * Fixing the constantly lit *brake warning* light problem was easy. The brake fluid reservior on the master brake cylinder was low. Topping the reservior to the max line with brake fluid triggered the brake fluid sensor to turn off the dashboard's *brake warning* light. Total time to identify and to fix the problem was around 15 minutes. 

    * Fixing the constantly lit *check engine* light was somewhat easy. I used an [OBD](http://www.cnet.com/news/a-brief-intro-to-obd-ii-technology) (on-board diagnostics) computer to track the problem to a bad O2 (oxygen) sensor. The new O2 sensor cost around $75 and it was easy to replace because the sensor is located on the front of the Accord's engine. No more lit *check engine* light. Total time to identify and to fix the problem was around 20 minutes (excluding the time needed to buy the new O2 sensor).

    * Fixing the heavy rattling noise was less easy. With the front of the car up on jack stands I replicated the heavy rattling noise with the car on Drive and while stepping repeatedly on the brake. Being at the driver's seat prevented me from visually inspecting the engine when the car rattled. With my brother's help I identified a broken engine mount as the problem. My brother recommended that I replace all three engine mounts that we could identify. I decided for now to replace only the broken engine mount, which cost around $65 for a new one. Total time to identify and fix the problem was around 45 minutes (excluding the time needed to buy the new engine mount).

    * Rains were forecasted for the upcoming week so I put new windshield wiper blades on the Accord. I also rotated the Accord's tires and inflated the tires to 35 PSI. Oil, radiator, and windshield wiper fluids were at the correct levels.   

    After my dad retired from the Navy he started his own auto repair business. When my brother and I were teenagers our dad taught us how to diagnose and how to fix car problems.

    I'm able to fix most car problems that don't require the engine to be removed from the car (only because I don't have access to an engine lift). I have to be in the right mood to do car repairs, hence it taking me three months to address the Accord's three problems. 

    I'll initially want to take the car to an auto repair shop before telling myself to do the work myself. When I start doing the auto repair work I enjoy the activity.  

    For one of many things that he taught me, I'm forever thankful to [my dad](http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Feliciano+%22Chano%22-Santos&lc=4619&pid=173189675&mid=6199203) for teaching me auto repair.

* Coding and coding-related plans for this coming week:
    * Finish reviewing *Chapter 9 - Functions* of [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393979504&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=FXGSFN72DGVZSLIR) and start working on the chapter's Programming Projects.
