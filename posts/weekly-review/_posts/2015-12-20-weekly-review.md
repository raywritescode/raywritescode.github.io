* Early this week I got my Raspberry Pi off-site backup server running again. I had to reformat the SD card and copy the Raspberry Pi's last backup image to the SD card. 

    The off-site backup server returned to duty on Thursday night. I monitored the backup server's logs for two days that followed and found that file updates made to my home NAS were mirrored successfully to the backup server.

* I spent a total of 10.5 hours (8.5 of those hours this week) working on Chapter 8, Programming Project 9. I made the mistake of not thinking about a solution to the given problem in the simplest way possible. I ended up writing four code versions to solve the problem. The first two becoming throw-away code, the third is a working version, and the fourth is a refactored version of the third. 

    For the third version of the code I asked myself what steps I'd tell a five year-old to do in order solve the problem. Using this approach I coded a working solution from scratch in 2.5 hours. I decided to spend another hour in the next study session refactoring the code to make it more correct.

    The four versions of the code are on github at the following links:

    * [Version 1](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/blob/40dcac2fd327ca42efca7e00168f445e4d623ca5/ch08/c8p09.c) - Almost walks A through Z in connected sequence.

    * [Version 2](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/blob/571e3c929eba06e35a8e9c59f978fd90c9bba7aa/ch08/c8p09.c) - Rewrote the code, which made the program less correct.  

    * [Version 3](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/blob/158446d0e4613d8ad70b0a08ec95bc775f31bd74/ch08/c8p09.c) - Code now solves the programming problem.

    * [Version 4](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2/blob/dadd8e5b2f54e5246f911b8e89858fa579b88ba2/ch08/c8p09.c) - Final version. Refactored Version 3 to make it more correct.

* After completing nine of the 17 programming projects in Chapter 8 I decided to move forward to *Chapter 9 - Functions*.

    **Total coding study time invested this week is 10.5 hours**.

* Coding and coding-related plans for this coming week:
    * Finish reviewing *Chapter 9 - Functions* of [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393979504&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=FXGSFN72DGVZSLIR) and start working on the chapter's Programming Projects. 
    * Write a blog post (carried forward from this ending week), with pictures, about the 8GB memory kit and the 250GB SSD upgrades done to the MacBook Pro.
