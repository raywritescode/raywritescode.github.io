* The MacBook Pro 8GB memory kit and the 250GB SSD upgrades were completed on Tuesday, 12/8. Except for not having a small enough Allen hex key (I ended up using long nosed pliers) tool to remove four support pins from the old hard disk to install on the new SSD, the upgrades process didn't run into any other problems.

    The MacBook Pro boots noticeably faster than before the upgrades. The Xcode application (and all the standard Mac OS X apps that I tested) also launch noticeably faster.

* Also on Tuesday, 12/8, I finished reviewing *Chapter 8 - Arrays* of [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393979504&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=FXGSFN72DGVZSLIR) by K.N. King. 

    I spent the rest of the week working on Programming Projects 8 and 9 from the chapter, both using multidimensional arrays. *Chapter 8* has 17 programming projects and I've completed Projects 1 through 8. After I complete Project 9 I'll feel comfortable and confident enough with arrays in C to move forward to *Chapter 9 - Functions*. 

    Links to this week's *Chapter 8* code are available in the *Study Log* page. 

    Total coding study time invested this week is 8 hours, same as last week.

* The SD card on my [Raspberry Pi off-site backup server](http://www.raywritescode.com/offsite-backup-server/) got corrupted earlier this week, which made the server unavailable to receive new backup data from [my home network's NAS](http://www.raywritescode.com/raspberry-pi-nas/).

    This evening I brought the Raspberry Pi off-site backup server home from its remote location. Getting the off-site backup server fixed and back into service is my highest priority for this coming week.  

* Coding and coding-related plans for this coming week:
    * Get my Raspberry Pi off-site backup server running again and put back into service.
    * Complete Chapter 8, Programming Project 9. 
    * Review *Chapter 9 - Functions* of *C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition.*
    * Write a blog post, with pictures, about the 8GB memory kit and the 250GB SSD upgrades done to the MacBook Pro.
