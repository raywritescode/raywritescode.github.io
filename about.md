*SqaDev* is a blog about Software Quality Assurance and Software Development.

I’m Ray Santos, and I’m writing to you from San Diego, CA.

This is my personal blog. I started it to publish notes, HOW-TOs, articles, stories, and essays about topics in software quality assurance and testing, software development, and computer-related technology.

My professional career is in software quality assurance and software testing. If you live in the U.S. and you’ve prepared your tax return using commercial software or through a CPA who uses commercial software, chances are pretty high that I’ve tested components of that software application.
