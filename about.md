Hello, World.

May I call you "World?"

That sounded wierd. How about...

Hello, Friend.

May I call you "Friend?"

My name is Ray.

*Ray.writes.code( )* is a collection of my written thoughts, random notes, and personal projects logs related to software development.

Practicing and learning about software development is one of my favorite hobbies. I don't do coding or programming professionally.

Many of my blog posts might come across as not being fully developed to you because those posts are meant to be reminders for me.

However, you might find a blog post or more that is written for a larger audience.

This blog intentionally doesn't provide a way to let you leave comments. 

If you want to contact me then send an email note to hello at raywritescode dot com.
