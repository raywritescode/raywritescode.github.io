*Ray Writes Code* is a blog about Software Development and Software Testing.

I’m Ray Santos, and I’m writing to you from San Diego, CA.

This is my personal blog. I started it to publish notes, HOW-TOs, articles, stories, and essays about topics in software development, software testing, and computer-related technology.

My professional career has primarily been in software quality assurance and software testing. If you live in the U.S. and you’ve prepared your tax return using commercial software or through a CPA who uses commercial software, chances are pretty high that I’ve tested components of that software application.

My career emphasis is now on software design and software development.

This blog might interest you if you’re a hobbyist programmer or someone who is considering a career change into software development.
