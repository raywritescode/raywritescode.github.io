I’m Ray Santos, and I’m writing to you from San Diego, CA.

My professional career has been in software quality assurance and software testing. If you live in the U.S. and you’ve prepared your tax return using commercial software or through a CPA who uses commercial software, chances are pretty high that I’ve tested components of that software application.

This is my personal blog. I started it to publish notes, HOW-TOs, articles, stories, and essays about topics in software development and technology that I encounter on my journey to working as a professional software developer.

This blog might interest you if you’re a hobbyist programmer or someone who is considering a career change into software development and wants to read about one person’s experiences toward making the change.
