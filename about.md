Hello, World.

My name's Ray. 

Learning how to write code that makes a computer do interesting things and to solve problems is one of my favorite hobbies. 

There are hundreds of programming languages to choose from. 

I'm most interested in the following three languages:

* C (a procedural language)
* Java (an object-oriented language)
* Scheme (a functional language)

For each published post on *Ray.writes.code( )* I will identify a problem, describe my thought process to formulate a solution to the problem, and show the code that I wrote to solve the problem.   

If you want to contact me you can reach me via email at hello at raywritescode dot com.
