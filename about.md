*Ray Writes Code* is a blog about Software Development and Software Quality Assurance and Testing.

I’m Ray Santos, and I’m writing to you from San Diego, CA.

This is my personal blog. I started it to publish notes, HOW-TOs, articles, stories, and essays about topics in software development, software quality assurance and testing, and computer-related technology.

My professional career is in software quality assurance and software testing. If you live in the U.S. and you’ve prepared your tax return using commercial software or through a CPA who uses commercial software, chances are pretty high that I’ve tested components of that software application.

This blog might interest you if you’re a hobbyist programmer or someone who is considering a career change into software development or software quality assurance and testing.
