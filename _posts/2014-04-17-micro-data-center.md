In the [previous blog post](http://www.raywritescode.com/raspberry-pi-nas/) you were introduced to my Raspberry Pi (RPi) NAS. 

Here's where it's housed. 

![dataCenterCloseUp](/images/dataCenterCloseUp.png)

Starting from the lower-left and moving clockwise, the micro data center consists of:

* **Raspberry Pi NAS** To allow for air flow around both hard drives I cut one pair of disposable chopsticks and used the four pieces in two pairs to raise NAS02 off the shelf floor and to raise NAS01 off NAS02. 

* **APC Back-UPS ES 550** gives the micro data center about 30 to 40 minutes of backup power in case my home loses electricity. The ES 550 emits a loud and shrill buzzing sound when it kicks into backup power mode. 

* **APC 7-outlet surge protection bar** was needed because the ES 550′s backup-powered outlets are near the shelf floor. The three power packs plugged into backup-powered outlets cluttered the floor area. The surge protection bar is plugged into one of the ES 550′s backup-powered outlets and the bar puts the three power packs up and out of the way.

* **Motorola SURFboard SB6141 cable modem** I bought early 2013 after my internet provider increased the price of my cable modem lease $3/month. If I could go back in time, one of the many things I’d do over smarter the second time around would include buying my own cable modem up front instead of leasing a cable modem for eight years.
* **Linksys E1200 Wi-Fi N300 Router** was purchased about three weeks ago to replace a faithful Linksys WRT54G that I used since 2006. The WRT54G went to my parents’ house to provide wireless internet access to an iPad that I bought for my mom.

* **The ice cream sandwich looking thing** between the RPi NAS and router is a [TITAN USB-DIY Dual-Way Fan](http://youtu.be/t6Vy9mDh1mE). ![titanFan](/images/titanFan.png) The fan is housed in a foam case with a foam base to absorb the spinning fan’s vibration. The fan is plugged into the powered-USB hub and is whisper quiet. It runs 24/7. 

## How Micro Is It?

The micro data center occupies the bottom shelf of a small entertainment center next to my bed. This picture gives you a sense of scale of how micro the data center is.

The entertainment center has a glass front door. The bottom shelf was previously occupied by books before serving as the micro data center space.

Note the black strip on the face of the cable modem. It’s made of a scrap piece of manila envelope cut 1-inch by 3-inches that was painted black using a Magic Marker. 

The black strip is used to block the modem’s power and activity lights, which uncovered light up my room enough making it difficult for me to fall asleep at night.

The strip is taped to modem's top edge so the strip can be lifted like a flap for when I need to observe the lights.

## Conclusion

Up until last week the data on my two-year old computer had never been backed-up. My home network equipment was scattered under my bed, covered with a layer of dust, and with no backup power source.

Now my computer data is backed-up daily with redundancy. My home network equipment is clean and organized, cooled 24/7, and has up to 40 minutes of backup power.
