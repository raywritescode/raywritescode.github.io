Yesterday my local UPS delivery guy dropped off a package that started me on the road to 1Z0-803.

1Z0-803 is the number for Oracle's [Certified Associate Java SE 7 Programmer] (http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-803) exam. 

The package contained the long titled book [OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer I & II Study Guide (Exams 1Z0-803 & 1Z0-804)] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071772006). 

Today is October 23, 2014. The book's official release date is October 24, 2014, which makes it the most *hot off the press* book I've purchased to-date. 

Me so geek.
