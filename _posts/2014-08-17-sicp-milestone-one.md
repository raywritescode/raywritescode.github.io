Four days ago I completed my first *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP) milestone, which was reading through the end of [section 1.1.7](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.7) and completing the first set of eight programming exercises that start in [section 1.1.6](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.6). 

The SICP book uses [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) as its programming language which, so far, I'm enjoying how to use because it's forcing me to write programs using a different programming language paradigm. Scheme is also forcing me to formulate [recursive solutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29) to problems.  

## The Wizard Book

The SICP is colloquially known as the *wizard book* because of the two wizards on the [book's cover](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). You learn at the start of Chapter 1 why wizards are on the book's cover.

## SICP != Learn Scheme in 24 Hours (or 30 days)

I had to read the first 25 pages of SICP three times before I was ready to tackle the exercises. Even after completing the exercises, I had to read the 25 pages a fourth time to make sure that I understood the material. It's going to be a slow journey that I think will result in a big payout at the end. 

## Exercise Solutions 

Here are links to my exercise solutions.

* [Exercise 1.1](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.1.scm) - Practice evaluating Scheme expressions.

* [Exercise 1.2](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.2.scm) - Translate a given expression into Scheme prefix form.

* [Exercise 1.3](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.3.scm) - Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the square of the two larger numbers. (I enjoyed working on this exercise)

* [Exercise 1.4](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.4.scm) - Describe the behavior of a given procedure.

* [Exercise 1.5](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.5.scm) - Describe the differences in behavior of an expression based on two procedures if the Scheme interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation for the first run and normal evaluation for the second run. (I enjoyed working on this exercise)

* [Exercise 1.6](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.6.scm) - A special form expression versus a user-defined version of the expression. (Interesting exercise)

* [Exercise 1.7](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.7.scm) - Describe the behavior of a given procedure when using extremely small and extremely large numbers.

* [Exercise 1.8](https://github.com/raywritescode/sicp/blob/master/ch01/exercises/exercise-1.8.scm) - Implement a procedure that uses Newton's method to calculate the cube root of a given number. (My favorite of this set of exercises)
