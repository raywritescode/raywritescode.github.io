On January 17, 2014 I posted [my developer goals for the year](http://www.raywritescode.com/developer-goals-2014/). This blog post is my mid-year review of those goals. 

## Review - Launch a Redesigned Blog Site and Publish Content Regularly

Up until June I published at least one new blog post every ten days. The blog posts mainly covered Android development, Java programming, and Raspberry Pi projects. I'm satisfied with my blog posting frequency and the content of my blog posts for the first half of this year.  

For five weeks spanning part of June and July I didn't write any blog posts and I did little coding studying because a death in the family had me doing funeral planning and post-funeral work. Blogging and coding studies fell to the bottom of my priorities list during that time.

Starting last week I felt ready to return to blogging and coding studies.  

### Goal Update - Publish one new blog post each week

The original goal was to publish two new blog posts each week. I learned that after publishing a new blog post I didn't want to write again until at least four days had passed. The updated goal of one new blog post per week better fits my writing habits.          

The original goal also included redesigning the raywritescode.com blog site, which wasn't a good goal to include because I had already redesigned the site before publishing the blog post. I've dropped the *Redesigned Blog Site* portion of the goal. 

Ironically, last week I moved this blog site from WordPress to GitHub Pages, which required redesigning the site.

## Review - Build my Java and Android Programming Skills to an Intermediate Level

I completed three programming courses:

* a four-month Java course in two weeks

* a full eight-week Android course 

* 14-hours of JavaScript training

Despite having completed those three programming courses and experimenting with Java and Android on small side projects, I still consider myself a novice programmer. I've been focusing too much on learning programming languages syntax and nothing else.   

### Goal Update - Data Structures & Algorithms and SICP

I've decided to work on broadening my software developer knowledge and skills for the rest of this year.

#### Data Structures & Algorithms

I can talk in general terms about data structures and algorithms and sound knowledgeable about them. 

However, put an erasable marker in my hand and ask me to write pseudocode or programming language code on a whiteboard to demonstrate those data structures and algorithms and I'll struggle.

My guide to improving my working knowledge of data structures and algorithms is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032157351X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=032157351X&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=VDQQF76W62ZFHSPH">Algorithms (4th Edition)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=032157351X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The book's authors provide great learning support for their book through a [companion website](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) and two free Coursera online courses, [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) and [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII).

All the code examples in the book are written in Java, so I'll have lots of opportunities to continue reading and writing Java code.

#### SICP

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262510871/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262510871&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=6XFQUNUUB4QQRVTL">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262510871" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

You'll almost always find SICP near the top of many "must read" book lists for software developers who want to become better coders professionally. I want to become a better coder. 

Kai Wu's blog post [Why And How to Start Your SICP Trek](http://hackerretreat.com/why-how-start-sicp/) convinced me start the trek.  

Everything needed for the SICP journey is freely available online.

* [SICP book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

* [MIT/GNU Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/)

* MIT's SICP course [readings](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/readings/), [lecture notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/lecture-notes/), and [video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)

## Review - Contribute to the Open Source Community

At the start of this year I intended to initially contribute to an open source project in a testing role or a documentation role. I explored a dozen open source projects that interested me but I wasn't inspired to join any of them.

### Goal Update - Drop the Open Source Contribution Goal

Blogging about software development, working through the data structures and algorithms book, and working through the SICP book will keep me plenty busy through the end of this year. 

Although I won't be contributing to the Open Source community for the time being, I'll hopefully be contributing in some small way to the general software development community through this blog's content and through the content of [my GitHub account](http://www.github.com/raywritescode). 

# Conclusion

I found this exercise of reviewing my original goals mid-year and making goals adjustments worthwhile. I believe the updated goals, and the work associated with them, will help me more than the original goals toward becoming a better software developer by year's end.
