I decided to have a set of Developer goals for 2014. Here’s what I aim to achieve.

## Launch a Redesigned Blog Site and Publish Content Regularly

Today I finally found a site design that I like. If you’re reading this, then you’re looking at the new site design. It’s minimalist and clean and generous with its use of white space.

This site had gone through several widget and plug-in configurations and various color schemes after I first launched it in April 2013. It was my first time administering a blogging application on a personal domain and I couldn’t help myself from exploring and testing a variety of site features and options combinations.

I plan to publish at least two posts each week about topics in software development and technology. The posts will consist of notes, HOW-TOs, articles, and essays to share my experience with the online community. 

Last year I published 29 posts but I was still finding my writer’s voice. I decided to make those posts private and have this Goals post lead my writer’s charge into 2014.

## Build my Java and Android Programming Skills to an Intermediate Level

General application development using Java and mobile application development using Android are the two areas where I want to work professionally as a software developer.

Last year at this time I had recently completed a 9-week Android programming course. Before that I completed a 9-week Java programming course covering advanced data structures. 

My day job in software testing and QA didn’t use Java or Android and I didn’t maintain those skills through personal projects. By the end of 2013 I was focused on improving my knowledge of C and my Java and Android skills had gotten rusty. 

I’ve started the ball rolling on the 2014 Java and Android goals. Brand new Java and Android books are traveling to my house from amazon.com and will arrive in a few days. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a fresh install of Java, Eclipse, and the Android SDK and I’ve been catching up on all things Android on [developer.android.com](http://developer.android.com/).

## Contribute to the Open Source Community

There are a couple of open source projects that I’m interested in contributing to. I’ll initially contribute in a testing role and possibly also a documentation role until I get my Java and Android programming skills back to where they were in January 2013.

I’m looking forward to getting started on this goal. Hopefully this year will also find me with a personal project to share with the open source community.

Keep an eye on my [GitHub profile](http://www.github.com/raywritescode) this year for more green.
