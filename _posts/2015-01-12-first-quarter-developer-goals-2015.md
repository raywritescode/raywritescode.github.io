For 2015 I've decided to set quarterly developer goals and to focus on one goal for the current quarter.

###Developer goal for the first quarter of 2015
Pass the *Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 7 Programmer I* exam.

###How I will accomplish this goal 
* Set aside two hours daily to study the book *OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer I & II Study Guide* by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates.
* Write exploratory Java code for all the language concepts presented in the study guide. 
* Complete five mock exams with a score of 90% or higher.
* Sit for the exam.

###How I will know the goal is met
I pass the exam on or before March 31, 2015

###What's my motivation?
My career is in software quality assurance and software testing. I want to increase my value as a software QA professional by improving my coding knowledge and skills. 

Improved coding skills will enable me to better develop new, and to better maintain existing, testing tools used to streamline the software testing process. 

Java is a ubiquitous object-oriented programming language. 

Studying programming languages is a fun intellectual hobby.
