# Pragmatic Technical Book Reviewer

My coding-related activites for September didn't include blogging. Instead, I took advantage of the opportunity to do a technical review of the first three chapters of the soon-to-be-released book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1941222595/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1941222595&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=LXNM7CYPH34Z7PD7">Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1941222595" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 by [Jeff Langr] (http://langrsoft.com), which will be published by [The Pragmatic Bookshelf] (https://pragprog.com/).

I've reviewed (and edited) technical documents as part of my normal activities in previous software jobs. Reviewing Jeff's book was my first experience contributing as a technical reviewer for a book author and a book publisher. 

I'm looking forward to reading the published version of *Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8* and seeing which of my contributions made it into the book. 

I'm also looking forward to more opportunities in the future to contribute as a technical reviewer for The Pragmatic Bookshelf and for other software developer book publishers.

# T-Minus Three Months

October marks the last three months of my transition preparation from software quality assurance to software development. 

Java is my primary development language, so I'm focusing my efforts on mastering the language as best as I can for the rest of this year. 

Improving my understanding and implementation of algorithms is the other skill that I'm working on for the next three months.

# There's More to Life Than Coding (Gasp!)

## Timer

It's easy for me to lose track of time when I'm writing code or doing other software development work at my computer. I enjoy the activity and mental exercise so much. 

Last month I picked up the habit of using a countdown timer to remind me when to take work breaks. Every hour I work for 50 minutes and then take a 10 minute break away from the computer. 

I can easily work 10-hour days at my stand-up computer desk and not feel physically exhausted (though I am mentally exhausted in a satisfying way).

## Guitar

Last month I also started learning how to play the guitar again. I was previously a chords-only guitar player. Now I'm working on reading music notation and playing individual notes on the guitar.

### Guitar Book 

The guitar book that I'm using is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0876390696/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0876390696&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=OAFCWCSLVG66T3AN">A Modern Method for Guitar - Volume 1: Book/DVD-ROM Pack (Method (Berklee Press)).</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0876390696" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>

The book comes with a computer-only DVD-ROM that contains 14.5 hours of video lessons given by [Larry Baione] (http://www.berklee.edu/people/larry-baione), who is the Chair of the [Berklee College of Music Guitar Department] (http://www.berklee.edu/guitar).

### Guitar Gear

My guitar is a [Squier Affinity Telecaster] (http://www.amazon.com/Squier-Fender-Affinity-Telecaster-Butterscotch/dp/B0002GOE6S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412615818&sr=8-1&keywords=B0002GOE6S) electric guitar in color Butterscotch Blonde with maple fingerboard that I bought in December 2010. The amp that I use is a 2004 Fender Bullet 150.

Before buying the Squier Affinity Telecaster I had my eyes set on the [Fender American Standard Telecaster] (http://www.fender.com/series/american-standard/american-standard-telecaster-maple-fingerboard-3-color-sunburst/) with Sunburst colored body and maple fingerboard. However, I couldn't justify the price tag for my guitar novice skill level.

Then I considered going one model series below and getting the Made-in-Mexico [Fender Standard Telecaster] (http://www.fender.com/guitars/telecaster/standard-telecaster-maple-fingerboard-brown-sunburst-no-bag/) also with Sunburst colored body and maple fingerboard, which costs about 60% less (as of this writing) than the Fender American Standard Telecaster. Still, I couldn't justify the price tag for my guitar novice skill level.

I took my Squier Telecaster to guitar technician Fred Marotta at [The Repair Zone San Diego] (http://youtu.be/pHnEZ0mcon8) to have the guitar professionally setup and adjusted to use .10 to .46 gauge strings ([Ernie Ball 2221 Regular Slinky] (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002M6CVC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002M6CVC&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=M4PLQB454SHQLKZ3">Ernie Ball 2221 Regular Slinky</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0002M6CVC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)). Fred and his team did a great job making my budget Squier electric guitar sound and play like its more expensive Fender cousins.

### Guitar Goal

On the inside back cover of my *Modern Method for Guitar, Volume 1* book I wrote the following note to myself:

    When I complete this book I give myself permission to buy
    any acoustic guitar or electric guitar and tube amp, 
    regardless of price.   

As of this writing I'm currently studying page 15 of the 127 page book. It will probably take 1.5 years for me to complete the book if I continue my pace of learning how to play the notes on each page with a clear and clean sound and with proper rhythm following a metronome before moving to the next page.

Knowing how I am about buying non-essential things (especially **expensive** (to me) non-essential things), chances are high that I won't actually buy a new guitar "regardless of price" after I complete the *Modern Method for Guitar, Volume 1* book.

I'll realistically continue on to *Modern Method for Guitar, Volume 2* with my Squier Affinity Telecaster.

Still, it's nice having the goal.
