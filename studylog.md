### December 2015
This month continues my refresher study of the C programming language to prepare for learning Objective-C starting January 1, 2016. 

The book that I'm studying from is [C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition](http://amzn.to/1O2vzz7) by K.N. King. 

The C source code written during these study sessions are available at [github.com/raywritescode/cpma2](https://github.com/raywritescode/cpma2)
